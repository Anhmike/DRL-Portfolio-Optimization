# DRL-Portfolio-Optimization
A portfolio optimization framework leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)

## Motivation
This repo was created during an Independent Study with [Professor Yelena Larkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yelena-larkin-6b7b361b/) 
as part of a concurrent Master of Business Administration (MBA) and [Diploma in Financial Engineering](https://schulich.yorku.ca/programs/fnen/)
from [Schulich School of Business](https://schulich.yorku.ca/).  The study was broken into 3 terms as described below.

#### Term 1 - Initial Investigation (Winter 2019)
The first term was a general investigation into "_Application of Machine Learning to Portfolio Optimization_".  Here we
review the different aspects of machine learning and their possible applications to Portfolio Optimization.  During this 
investigation we highlighted **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** as an especially promising area to research and proposed 
the development of a Reinforcement Learning framework to better understand its possible applications.  

Please see the 1st term [report](docs/fine_6900_w19_daniel_fudge_final.pdf) for the detailed discussion.  

#### Term 2 - Architectural Design (Fall 2019)
##### Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree
The [1st term report](docs/fine_6900_w19_daniel_fudge_final.pdf) identified the Udacity "Deep Reinforcement Learning" 
Nanodegree as a first step toward gaining a better understanding of this topic.  Both the [syllabus](docs/DRL_Nanodegree_Syllabus.pdf)
or the [site](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893) provides a detailed 
description of the Nanodegree.  
This Nanodegree involved the developing DRL networks to solve 3 different [Unity ML-Agents environments](https://unity3d.com/machine-learning/).
The solutions to these environment can be found in separate GitHub repositories:
- [Banana Collector](https://github.com/daniel-fudge/banana_hunter)
- [Reacher](https://github.com/daniel-fudge/reinforcement-learning-reacher)
- [Tennis](https://github.com/daniel-fudge/reinforcement-learning-tennis)

##### Architectural Design Report
With the Udacity Nanodegree complete, the next step will be to design the required architecture and problem statement
for the DRL framework for portfolio optimization.  
This is currently underdevelopment in [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R71LMO0FALjnGl-yVFwi0FpsfboV5ViDzBo8-KZDuA4/edit?usp=sharing)
Google Doc.  Once complete, a pdf version will be added to this repository.  

#### Term 3 - Implementation (Winter 2020)
With the problem statement and architecture defined in the term 2 report, it will be the task of term 3 to fully 
implement the architecture.  Note that the intent of this implementation is not to advance the state-of-the-art in DRL 
or its application to portfolio optimization.  Instead it is to get a functioning architecture operational.  From this 
conventional implementation, we can experiment with more advanced techniques.
