# DRL-Portfolio-Optimization
A portfolio optimization framework leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)

## Motivation
This repo was created during an Independent Study of [Daniel Fudge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-fudge) with [Professor Yelena Larkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yelena-larkin-6b7b361b/) 
as part of a concurrent Master of Business Administration (MBA) and a [Diploma in Financial Engineering](https://schulich.yorku.ca/programs/fnen/)
from the [Schulich School of Business](https://schulich.yorku.ca/).  The study was broken into 3 terms as described 
below.

#### Term 1 - Initial Investigation (Winter 2019)
The first term was a general investigation into the "_Application of Machine Learning to Portfolio Optimization_".  Here 
we reviewed the different aspects of machine learning and their possible applications to Portfolio Optimization.  During 
this investigation we highlighted **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** as an especially promising area to research and 
proposed the development of a Reinforcement Learning framework to better understand its possible applications.  

Please see the 1st term [report](docs/report1.pdf) for the detailed discussion.  

#### Term 2 - Architectural Design (Fall 2019)
##### Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree
The [1st term report](docs/report1.pdf) identified the Udacity "Deep Reinforcement Learning" 
Nanodegree as a first step toward gaining a better understanding of this topic.  Both the [syllabus](docs/DRL_Nanodegree_Syllabus.pdf)
and the [site](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893) provide a detailed 
description of the Nanodegree.  
This Nanodegree involved the developing DRL networks to solve 3 different [Unity ML-Agents environments](https://unity3d.com/machine-learning/).
The solutions to these environments can be found in the following GitHub repositories:
- [Banana Collector](https://github.com/daniel-fudge/banana_hunter)
- [Reacher](https://github.com/daniel-fudge/reinforcement-learning-reacher)
- [Tennis](https://github.com/daniel-fudge/reinforcement-learning-tennis)

##### Architectural Design Report
With the Udacity Nanodegree complete and a greater understanding of DRL obtained, the 2nd term report found [here](docs/report2.pdf) 
was generated to detail the proposed "_Deep Reinforcement Learning Architecture for Portfolio Optimization_".  This 
report also described the future research required prior to the 3rd term implementation and suggest future work after 
the 3rd term implementation is complete.  

#### Term 3 - Implementation (Winter 2020)
With the problem statement and architecture defined in the [term 2 report](docs/report2.pdf), it will be the task of 
term 3 to fully implement the architecture.  Note that the intent of this implementation is not to advance the 
state-of-the-art in DRL or its application to portfolio optimization.  Instead it is to generate a functioning DRL 
platform for portfolio optimization.  From this conventional implementation, we can experiment with more advanced 
techniques as highlighted in the 2nd term report.   
Term 3 will also deliver a report that summarizes not only the implementation but also the development environment to 
lower the barrier to entry for researchers new to DRL and the deployment of cloud-based applications.
